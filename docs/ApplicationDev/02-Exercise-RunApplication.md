# Exercise: Run the client application

Let's make sure we can successfully run the client application and get some familiarity with how to use it.

First, spend a moment reading the sample application [README](../../applications/trader-typescript/README.md) and follow the instructions there to set up the client application and learn how to run the commands it provides from a terminal window.

1. Run the **getAllAssets** command to check the assets that currently exist on the ledger (if any).
1. Run the **transact** command to create (and update / delete) some more random assets.
1. Run the **getAllAssets** command again to see the new assets recorded on the ledger.

Optionally, you can try using the **create**, **read** and **delete** commands to work with specific assets.
